This is the second calculation that caculates the volume of a sphere. 
This will test the equation in the main code with these two numbers(2,3) to make sure that it gets the correct answer.

# Test cases for calculate_area_of_rectangle function
def test_calculate_area_of_rectangle():
    assert calculate_area_of_rectangle(3, 4) == 12
    assert calculate_area_of_rectangle(5, 5) == 25

# Test cases for calculate_volume_of_sphere function
def test_calculate_volume_of_sphere():
    assert calculate_volume_of_sphere(2) == 33.510321638291124
    assert calculate_volume_of_sphere(3) == 113.09733552923254
