This is the first calculation of my pytest code. 
I have imported the neccesary module that I needed to do the calculations as well as used numbers to test the calculations with.
This will test my area of a rectangle calculations in my main code with these numbers. 
If the numbers come out different in my main code, then they will fail and if they are the same then they will pass.
I used Python Libraries (https://docs.python.org/3/search.html?q=module) to learn about modules.

import pytest
import math
from A_V_calc_DWM import (
    calculate_area_of_rectangle,
)

# Test cases for calculate_area_of_rectangle function
def test_calculate_area_of_rectangle():
    assert calculate_area_of_rectangle(3, 4) == 12
    assert calculate_area_of_rectangle(5, 5) == 25
